## The Idea

This is a tool to help job-seekers manage their job applications in an organized manner and increase their chances of being hired.

We thought that applying for jobs can be overwhelming at times, the amount of applications companies receive is huge.
The amount of them which include a cover letter is less.
The amount of them that really gets their attention is possible to be counted on one hand.

Therefore, we designed a solution to keep the application pace high for the job hunter, get ready to face the interviews having an idea of what's coming and check people's reviews about a particular company to have an idea on how's the hiring process.

**Main features:**

- The landing page presents the page.
- Users can create accounts, sign in and out and perform actions as the logged in user.
- Users can add a job application and update the status of it.
- Users can generate a tailored resume and cover letter through AI.
- Users can train for tech job interviews receiving a feedback from an AI on their answers to the provided questions.
- Users can leave a review about the quality of the companies's hiring system and rate them.
